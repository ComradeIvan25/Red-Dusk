 ussr.1.t:0 "Union in Hibernation"
 ussr.1.d:0 "It has been less then 10 years from that fateful day, August 19th, 1991. The moment those tanks rolled into Moscow, nobody knew that we would be changing history; nobody understood the gravity of the situation at hand, of the unfolding events that would change the very course of Russia's path. In only about a week, our troops had secured Moscow and Leningrad, and with them, our greatest political opponents, traitors to the Soviet Union--men like Boris Yeltsin, who for his High Crimes against the party and Presidium were silently and swiftly "removed" from Politics. Some like Gorbachev were put under house arrest or simply moved away from government; others simply disappeared from the face of the Earth without a trace, so said the newspapers, now firmly back under the control of the General Secretary. It took a while, but soon enough, the nation had come to be stabilized enough for business to resume as usual; we had felt the sting of a sudden shift in power, seen the damage of a rapid passing off of such great authority, and yet we had weathered the storm. The Union would live on, and the "Great Reformer" would be put back on the shelf while Yanayev did what had to be done in order to save our most glorious motherland from demise. The Union would prevail; the Communist Dream, Lenin's great project, would continue onwards without falter, and we would no longer be so easily corrupted by the insidious influences of the Imperialist West! At least we hoped...  When we had committed to the movement, when we had put our support behind the Coup, we knew there would be consequences, some as dire as member states leaving, an economic shock, a political upheaval--and we knew we could deal with it all, one by one, step by step if need be. And yet here we stood, a nation hobbling its way along with one foot in an open grave, a red not so vibrant as the triumphant revolutionary it had once been. Where was Marx's sunrise? Our Glorious Red Star?"
 ussr.1.a:0 "Replaced by a Red Dusk."
 ussr.2.t:0 "The Feared Report"
 ussr.2.d:0 "The Union has undergone many reforms and changes in both positive and negative forms. It was a tough time but we marched on. After extensive investigations in the 1990s, the enemies of the state have been found and removed, except Mikhail Gorbachev, as he is considered to no longer be a threat to the stability of the Union. Further, the new head of the army is Dimitry Yazov, a feared and capable man that will lead the reformed Soviet Army. The new head of the KGB is a promising young man named Vladimir Putin, and he will be instrumental to the Soviet Union. Boris Pugo will be the permanent minister of Internal Affairs, as he played a big part in the August Coup so he will remain at his position."
 ussr.2.a:0 "Interesting"
 ussr.3.t:0 "The Economy Report"
 ussr.3.d:0 "The economy has never been as it is now. Even during the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, it was not as bad. Blockades, sanctions, and economic wars have been imposed on us by the West for over 50 years now. All of them with one goal: to cripple us. Sad to say that it appears that they are working. The Union's only future is to either reform or vanish. Our over-militarized economy is of no help either. As much as we can show our teeth to the West, if we cannot take care of our people first, it will lead to a disaster. We will have to do some reforming or the Union of the People will not last."
 ussr.3.a:0 "The Capitalists will pay!"
 ussr.4.t:0 "Yazov Protests"
 ussr.4.d:0 "Marshal Yazov issued a protest against Yanayev's decision of defunding the army. In his letter he stated that: “A country without a strong military cannot defend the workers’ revolution!”. As much as he is right, we cannot focus on only the military while our people worry about their future. This has triggered a party meeting about all the recent actions and the current state of the Soviet Union."
 ussr.4.a:0 "He should know his place"
 ussr.5.t:0 "The Resignation of Yanayev"
 ussr.5.d:0 "It was a quiet, normal morning in the office of the Politburo. Meeting announced by General Secretary Yanayev was unexpected to say the least, but none of the members of the highest governing body of the Soviet Union were ready for what was to come. Yanayev, General Secretary of the Soviet Union for the past decade and one of the instigators of the coup that saved the USSR, has resigned. Members of the Politburo were in shock but also very nervous. The moment they were waiting for came, as with Yanayev gone, it is finally their chance to become leaders of the Soviet Union. And it came just at the right time before the Party meeting."
 ussr.5.a:0 "Unexpected"
 ussr.6.t:0 "The Party Meeting"
 ussr.6.d:0 "It has been several days after Yanayev resigned as the General Secretary and a party meeting has begun. Tensions in the hall were high as many just waited for the opportunity to grab the position of the most powerful man in the USSR.\n\nMany deals, back stabs and shady actions have been going on far from public's eyes and ears. However even this long meeting has to come to an end. And as the speaker walked behind the microphone at the main stand, the final voting begun.\n\nThe next leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is..."
 ussr.6.a:0 "Dmitry Yazov!"
 ussr.6.b:0 "Boris Pugo!"
 ussr.6.c:0 "No one was able to get enough political support..."
 ussr.7.t:0 "The Meeting Continues"
 ussr.7.d:0 "It was a shock, not only to the lead speaker but to the whole party and the nation! Yazov and Pugo, both men in high positions and most influential people in the USSR have been rejected as the leaders! Speaker could barely come to his seance after this event. But in the end the meeting has been prolonged.\n\nThis was an opportunity two very optimistic men in the hall were waiting.\n\nIn the sudden and unexpected move, old reformer Mikhail Gorbachev, tough to be completely cut from politics raised from all the members and announced his plan to candidate for the leader of the USSR. It was no surprise to some who knew that the Politburo has rehabilitated him back into politics after he was pronounced to have changed his way and views.\n\nThe second one was Vladimir Putin, current head of the KGB and a promising new rising star of the party. The speaker was informed about his candidacy by a KGB officer present in the hall.  Putin had powerful friends everywhere and was favoured to win.\n\nAnd once again final voting begun and the next leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is..."

 usa.1.t:0 "The State of the Union"
 usa.1.d:0 "With the Soviet Union hobbling its way towards the 21st Century on its last legs, the Cold War had seemed all but over; the Americans watched as the Eastern Bloc ran off in its own, separate direction; watched as the Soviet’s allies began to receive less and less support from Moscow; watched as the dreaded Bear of the East slowly began to enter a permanent hibernation. And yet, for all intents and purposes, for some reason, it didn’t–it was weakened, certainly, but not dead by any means. The Soviet Union would live on, and the American political rings from all sides began to feel the shockwave of this revelation by early 1992. \n\nNo one was quite expecting the chances of Soviet survival; no one on the Left or Right thought it possible for the “Evil Empire” to retain in the world following the Coup, and the American Socialists were just as stunned that the rapidly reformed USSR had just been spun on its head, and as had their directives as political entities. The American nation hadn’t changed much because of it, but the attitude in the air wasn’t so much of “We’ve Won” but more so of “The War’s Still On.” Were the Soviets realistically a threat? Not particularly. Were the American people still on guard? Indeed. Reagan had sown the seeds of what many hoped was an end to the Cold War, and now, it seemed that his labors were just the beginning of the continued fight to put down the Bear. The spirit of the American nation would not be able to allow itself to put down its guard; it couldn’t accept the weakness of the Bear as a reason to finally let down their ethos that the Red Menace need be crushed at all costs. Though, unfortunately for the United States as a whole, not everyone quite agreed that the fight needed to go on, and instead began to wage a new war. \n\nThat fight would begin in the greatest tipping point in American History since the Civil War; a colossal shift in domestic and foreign policy that culminated with the devastatingly small margin, both sides were so close, so edged against one another, that for generations to come, the year 1992 would become the hotspot of a new battle within Washington itself; the Left and Right had come head to head in an internal contest to test the path of America, and to decide the fate of the Cold War, and thus, the fate of the world. And thus, 1992 would become host to..."

 usa.2.t:0 "1992: A Year to Decide"
 usa.2.d:0 "When 1992 came to pass, November Elections were growingly a to-be tense battle for all sides involved; the Republicans under incumbent, 41st President George H.W. Bush had been reeling from a mixed bag of successes–now complicated by an Economic Recession that seemingly only accentuated the President’s reneging on his promises to raise no taxes while in office; the Democrats had stepped forth with Arkansas Governor William “Bill” J. Clinton, a widely popular man of the people who sought to finally put an end to the Cold War’s spending frenzy, and coexist with the dying Soviet Union in a more peaceful world; out of the blue, an up-and-coming Texas Multimillionaire too decided to throw his hat into the Presidential ring, that being Ross Perot and his to-be-declared Reform Party, standing as a strong third option against the Democrats and Republicans for internal change across the board. All three sides had their issues, all three had their strengths, but none of them could rightly predict the outcome of the elections to come–simply by the density of the concern in the air. \n\nBush’s image had certainly been tarnished, but his Cold War efforts seemed all the more necessary as of the rise of the hostile regime under Yanayev’s more traditionally Soviet-style dictatorship out of Moscow; Clinton had the popular face, but nowhere near the credibility, and many were skeptical of the plan to let the Soviets ride peacefully into the sunset just as they began to recover from the initial shock of the August Coup; Ross Perot was a newcomer who challenged both parties with widely demanded issues, but was, indeed, outside of the two party primacy and thus nowhere near guaranteed victory at even the state level. The Republicans were reeling, the Democrats struggling, and Perot’s gang desperately clinging to whatever support they could get, and it all began to culminate together into one of if not the most tense elections of the 20th Century, not just in America, but globally. \n\nThe election was for all intents and purposes up in the air, even up until the night of, and no one quite knew what was going to happen between the popular vote or even the Electoral College–there was even blurring of the lines over how the states would vote. When voting began on November 3rd, results struggled to be tallied until early in the morning on the 4th, when every television, radio, and speaker in America blared out, before crowds of millions in bated breath..."

 usa.3.t:0 "The Outcome of 1992"
 usa.3.d:0 "Against all odds, Bush had by only beaten Clinton by 2 Electoral College votes, marking his victory of 264:262, with Ross Perot having stolen 6 by taking the states of Maine and Alaska: “The Most Contentious Election since 1860” claiming one CNN pundit in the aftermath of the elections. The Democrats as of this time had lost a good bit of their traditional support basin to Perot’s economically social platform and the Republican Party’s avidly Anti-Communist sentiments, both of which resonating in Democrat controlled Southern States, who still voted with far more Socially-Conservative issues in mind, allowing Bush with the far stronger ticket to sweep up several of Clinton’s southern Allies, despite being a Northerner, and was even able to tag a couple dozen delegates out of the Rust Belt with his efforts to continue to back war-based industries following his excursions in Iraq and Kuwait. Recounts, while triggered, failed to give Bill the victory he had desired, but it had revealed something rather appalling to the American people... \n\nBush had failed to win the Popular vote by around a million votes, and yet was able to barely by only two electoral college votes win the Presidency. This was not particularly aided when the Reform party would grab itself a foundation in New England, where Ross Perot, despite being a Southerner in Northern lands, had made a name for himself as the man with a plan; a balance between Republicans and Democrats, and an option that wasn’t too far in either direction. This outcome, overall, put America on a rather unstable path, and the following months were just as tumultuous. \n\nOn January 20th, when Bush was for a second time inaugurated as the United States President, almost half of the Crowd was not there out of support, but a massive protest numbering nearly 50,000 people strong, who would engage in a rather controversial “march” across the city that resulted in the burnings of several American flags, a Police Standoff with Protestors outside of the White House, and nearly five hundred arrests of for Civil Disobedience, Reckless Endangerment, and one for attempting to bludgeon a Police Officer. The Protests lasted all week before city Police alongside members of the National Guard could rein in order, and the seven days of Protest would become the start of a long spiral for America into what would later become known as..."

 usa.4.d:0 "The January Protests would be the first step of many in the descent towards the tension and unease of the ‘90s, a dangerous precedent set that seemed to be the road towards a greater time of unrest... That never really came. Just when everyone thought the American nation was on the brink of massive rioting, the chaos seemingly just stopped out of nowhere. The protesters all left en-masse in droves, the Republican party had refused to openly publicize the event as an attack on the President, and even the Media had quickly attempted to move on from the events. It was as though it had never happened, and yet, the tensions still hanged in the air. \n\nThis era was in no way for the American nation particularly bountiful and prosperous, but at the same time neither was it violent and bloody; while the odd riot or two still broke out in the cities between members of both the Left and Right, the decade itself didn’t follow in the trend of the January Riots. Instead, it followed more the aftermath; no one knew entirely how to feel, and the entire nation entered into a sort of gray zone, an imbalance in the universe itself as the entirety of America sat by for the ride. The tensions around every citizen were palpable, as though one could reach out and grab it, and yet it never came–no great eruption, no horrible collapse. Time simply moved on, and no one could entirely believe it. \n\nPresident Bush would continue to fight on for the next four years of his term in office, watching the Soviet’s every move, building relations in the former Eastern Bloc nations, and even working to oversee the reconstruction of Germany following a period of unrest in the reintegrated East. Bush would use these successes as a cudgel of sorts coming into the 1996 elections, with his popular Vice President Dan Quayle taking up the Republican ballot, and the victory in the end with 282 electoral college votes and 41% of the popular vote; Clinton ran again despite only barely beating out fellow Democrat Lyndon LaRouche at the primaries, and entering into the General elections faced a major blowout with only about 27% of the Popular Vote, and 181 Electoral College votes; Ross Perot on the other hand had advanced his position to taking 32% of the popular vote, securing all of New England, and a large portion of the California voting base. \n\nWith Three parties in the Senate and Congress by the end of the decade, the government had been rather much slowed down; an inability to respond appropriately to many issues, the emergence of Tripartisan politics, and the struggle to find a solution to the Soviet issue had left America in a position of indecisiveness. The Government by 1997 was now feeling the full effect that the nation itself had felt; division that did not tear asunder; a break in the chain and yet the continued march of progress. Time stood still, and yet it still flowed onwards. It was, as the name implied, all in a state of unease..."

 usa.5.t:0 "Where Are We Now?"
 usa.5.d:0 "With the turn of the Century into the year 2000, the United States now presses on towards what is looking like yet another divided election; while Quayle had been a relatively successful President, the divided Congress and Senate had prevented him from making many effective changes as the Uneasy ‘90s had rolled out the door, and the American economy and nation is starting to feel the recourse of those consequences; the economy’s growth is at its lowest rate since the Great Depression, and though it was up, so was inflation rising on the back of Cold War deficit spending; Quayle’s illness too with phlebitis wasn’t much helping his image as a strong and virile President, and the Democrats and Reformists were willing to use that to try and discredit him, though the damages had already been done, and no side involved was willing to attempt to put a match to the still fading aura of the ‘90s. \n\nNo one knew what to do, barely anyone knew how to react; life went on, and now the American people were starting to shake off the miasma that had hung over them for eight years. The Economic bubble looming on the horizon as well as the jubilance of the New Year had helped to shake off most of the unrest and indecisiveness among the public, but there were still many skeptical voices in the face of what seemed to be the next torch thrown wildly into the darkness of the unknown. \n\nWith the Soviet Union still trudging along, with the Government divided as ever, and with NATO starting to grow more and more fed up with American practices up to this point, all eyes were now turning on to the Land of the Free to get off the ground and start marching. Johnny came marching home from far worse, surely this wouldn’t be the end of the Yanks, and surely they would come out swinging, right? Surely this was the moment when the Star Spangled Banner flew bravely in the air, on land, and sea? Well... No one really knew, least so the Americans. Would the nation finally get back into gear, finally deal with the myriad of problems in front of them, finally put an end to the unease...?"
