 old_times_news.1.d:0 "Latest news coming out of the Soviet Union has shocked the world as Gennady Yanayev, a man who was the main instigator of the August Coup that "saved" the Soviet Union has resigned today from the position as General Secretary.\n\nWith the amount of speculations, rumors and theories and with the Kremlin releasing very little information about the resignation of Yanayev, not much is known about the reasons for this sudden move. Many political experts have made conclusions that this was either due to Yanayev’s  inability to fix Union's economic issue or pressure from within the party itself.\n\nHowever, with upcoming congress of the CPSU, this is truly unexpected event that may just change the course of the Soviet Union's global future."

With all the greetings and celebrations being done, it is believed that Yazov has already begun securing his power with the help of the Soviet military.\n\nMany observers believe that with Yazov's military career and expansionist politics, it is very likely that we would see wars and Soviet military expansion in the following decade."

It is believed that he has already begun consolidating his position and with KGB support will bring a the USSR to a new age.\n\nMany observers believe that Pugo, being the most hardline person in the party, will bring the Soviet Union back to the days of Yuri Andropov or even Joseph Stalin. What is to come will surely affect the internal situation in the USSR."

For now all that remains is speculations and wild guesses at best. What will become of this new Soviet Union, will it's new leader finish what he started or will it take the same hardline course?

Putin is a well respected right arm of the party, with KGB being his sword and his party connections being his shield. He is a mysterious and very possibly a powerful man of whom no one, outside of the USSR has any information.\n\nWill he bring in a new course in the USSR or will he continue Yannayev's legacy?

It would seem that Kremlin has had enough and is keen on finishing the unfinished job from the 90s. As of now, while the Soviet Army advances deeper into these countries, no official statement has left the Soviet Union.\n\nMeanwhile, United States and other NATO and EU countries have already prepared sanctions against the Soviet Union.

Citing rising maintenence costs and an overall unprofitable mode of transport, the company plans to sell the aircrafts to various museums across Europe, in a bid to preserve the 30 year old technological marvels.\n\nWhile French patriots have understandably baulked at the idea, this announcement has not been unsurprising for most, with figures on the programme's costly expenses having been publicly known for years. British Airways have made no announcements yet, however it is expected that they too will reduce their Concorde fleet in the coming months."

Like most calendars of the past millennia, it attempts to rectify its long-term imprecision by adding leap days and years with mathmetical calculation.\n\nEvery year divisible by four is a leap year, and therefore receives an extra day, the 29th February. However, this simple system results in three extra leap days every 400 years, so in the Gregorian calendar, century years are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. This results in century leap years every 400 years, and this year is one of those rare years, being only the second one to occur since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar itself."
