Still, his reputation as one of a capable man for the job who devoted himself to the orders and Soviet apparatus may not be entirely true as he is well known to be one of the most corrupt members of the said apparatus.\n\nThe road to the top has not been the cleanest one but there's still a long way to go..."

Our nation faced a period of unrest, inability, and most prominently of all, unease. Everything felt like it was on a breaking point, and though Quayle was able to barely sinch the election against Bill Clinton for a second time, it proved to us that, maybe just maybe, we’re not as invincible as we hoped..."

Though to the man’s credit, nothing’s gotten inherently worse, but most people aren’t glass half-full types nowadays. With approval ratings as low as 39% by some estimates, Quayle’s Presidency hasn’t done much to try and fix that issue; raising new taxes at the height of the recession, sending troops overseas once more to ensure our position in the Middle East, and generally being a very quiet, almost reserved public official--mostly on account of Quayle’s various, growing health concerns.

When the Stocks began to crawl away from the downturn in ‘98, we had hoped it would be the market kicking back into gear, but unfortunately, things didn’t improve much beyond that slowdown.

Ever since 1992, Ross Perot has become a thorn in our sides all the same, though heralding some weird amalgamation of our own values mixed with Democrat economic stances; a sort of Populist jambalaya combining the Welfare State with America-First doctrine, and yet it’s somehow the fastest growing political organization in America!

President Bush has decided the best way to deal with the issue is to start subsidizing the industries in the region, using tax-breaks and stimulus payments to revive the region’s wasted capacity to produce new goods.

The President and his cabinet seek to not only renew the Act, but further expand upon it, and set precedent to standardized assessments and grading as to encourage students to succeed, as well as give brackets on whether students should be given increased attention to help their developing educational careers.

It’s time to revert, for better or for worse, the tax increases that the former President put on the American people, and go even further!

Socialist Left party of Yugoslavia led by Mirjana Marković, declared itself to be a party of all "left-wing and progressive forces that believed that the general interest always comes above private interest", including communists, socialists, greens, social democrats, and democratic socialists. The Patriotic Communist party of Yugoslavia is an anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninist communist party of Serbia led by Vojislav Sesei.

Likely the most overt example was the confiscation of the four frigates and six corvettes that we purchased from Italy, which were never delivered following the Gulf War. It is finally time to invest in our own shipyards, instead of channeling money towards foreign powers that are under no real obligation to deliver on any promises."
 IRQ_purchase_foreign_ships:0 "Purchase Foreign Ships"
 IRQ_purchase_foreign_ships_desc:0 "There is a reason why countries buy ships from well-established shipbuilders: they're efficient, effective, and proven. We cannot afford to waste years building up designers and shipyards, with no guarantee that the product we'll produce will be suitable for our needs. Instead, our allies will be able to deliver the vessels we need, while we are better off focusing on other matters."

 IRQ_contest_no-fly_zone_desc:0 "The no-fly zones proclaimed by the coalition forces prevent our air force from operating over substantial parts of Iraq. This prevents our military from performing any significant operations against the Kurds, and severely restricts our capabilities in a potential conflict. While losses will be inevitable, it is time that our pilots fight back against the western menace that haunts our own skies!"
 IRQ_construct_air_defenses:0 "Construct Air Defenses"
 IRQ_construct_air_defenses_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our air force is no match against the coalition forces, being beaten in both quantity and quality. However, as countless wars have proven, potent air defenses can deter even the most deadly air force. By constructing an elaborate network of modern air defense systems around our population centers, coalition aircraft will have to exercise much greater caution when entering our airspace."

Our aircraft are now free to rule the skies, and our ground forces no longer have to fear being attacked from above. From now on, we can fully focus on rebuilding and restructuring our air force, and rebuild its once proud reputation."
 IRQ_legacy_mohammed_rayyan:0 "Legacy of Mohammed Rayyan"
 IRQ_legacy_mohammed_rayyan_desc:0 "During the Iran-Iraq War, Mohammed Rayyan was one of our most deadly pilots, scoring at least five air combat kills against Iranian aircraft. His incredible skill gave him access to the MiG-25, the rapid interceptor guarded by Soviet advisors that only allowed the best of the best to fly it. Unfortunately tragedy struck in 1986, when he was shot down by one of Iran’s aces, Jalil Zandi.\n\nThis story should serve to inspire our current generation of pilots, who are used to cowering away from the coalition aircraft that used to patrol our skies. It is through boldness and determination that our air force has survived, and how it will continue to prosper in the years to come."
 IRQ_regular_sorties:0 "Regular Sorties"
 IRQ_regular_sorties_desc:0 "One of the key indicated of a well-trained air force is the number of flight hours a pilot receives per year. After all, there is no better way to train a pilot than to test his skills in real conditions. We must ramp up the number of sorties performed by our air force, which will allow us to both train our pilots and master the logistics behind high-intensity operations."
 IRQ_aircraft_acquisition:0 "Aircraft Acquisition"
 IRQ_aircraft_acquisition_desc:0 "Our air force is severely lacking in aircraft, with a significant portion being lost during the Gulf War and the years following it.

 IRQ_soviet_training:0 "Soviet Training"
 IRQ_soviet_training_desc:0 "Ever since the late 1950s, the Soviet Union has operated a training center for foreign pilots: the 5th Training Center in Frunze. This allows for Soviet-friendly nations to send their best pilots for training, which provides them with modern tactics, skills, and aircraft. With our own skies being under constant watch by coalition forces, and our aircraft largely decades out of date, sending our pilots to the Soviets will no doubt be of great benefit to us."
 IRQ_desert_camouflage:0 "Desert Camouflage"
 IRQ_desert_camouflage_desc:0 "Unlike other armies, we do not have the luxury of operating under friendly skies. We cannot rely on our pilots to shield us from enemy attackers, and therefore we must make sure they never see us in the first place. Camouflage can buy valuable time by disorientating enemy pilots, which is often enough to save our units on the ground."

 IRQ_reform_iraqi_army_desc:0 "The Iraqi Army makes up the backbone of our armed forces, bearing the brunt of combat in any potential conflict. However despite its important role, it is poorly equipped and trained, with funding often being misappropriated and high ranks being filled with loyal puppets instead of competent commanders. It is time to perform a purge of the high command, and conduct a reform of the entire system."

 IRQ_prioritise_republican_guard_desc:0 "Our traditional army is weak, corrupt, and unmotivated. Relying on them for any major offensive or defensive operations would be a mistake, with their performance in both the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War being subpar at best. Instead, we must invest into our loyal Republican Guard, which consists of our most elite troops outfitted with the best weapons we have to offer."
 IRQ_loyal_army_of_saddam:0 "The Loyal Army of Saddam"
 IRQ_loyal_army_of_saddam_desc:0 "As any autocrat knows, the loyalty and strength of their military is the lifeline of their regime.

 IRQ_lessons_from_desert_storm:0 "Lessons from Desert Storm"
 IRQ_lessons_from_desert_storm_desc:0 "The Desert Storm campaign of the coalition forces in the 1990s all but destroyed our military. The terrific airpower of the west sunk our navy, neutralised our air defenses, and caused our air force to flee. This mistake must not be repeated again, and our army must be trained to counter such ‘shock-and-awe’ tactics."
 IRQ_request_foreign_aid:0 "Request Foreign Aid"

Why change what has been proven successful?"
 IRQ_expand_domestic_industry:0 "Expand Domestic Industry"
