However, other nations, including the supported nation, also have the ability to §Rdecrease§! the number of §Yinfluence points§! that you have.\n\nOnce a country has §Gfully recovered§!, you will not be able to influence it. If the number of influence points is sufficiently high (over 5 points, and over 75% of the total points), then that country will fall under your §Ysphere of influence§!."
