Though to the man’s credit, nothing’s gotten inherently worse, but most people aren’t glass half-full types nowadays. With approval ratings as low as 39% by some estimates, Quayle’s Presidency hasn’t done much to try and fix that issue; raising new taxes at the height of the recession, sending troops overseas once more to ensure our position in the Middle East, and generally being a very quiet, almost reserved public official--mostly on account of Quayle’s various, growing health concerns.

When the Stocks began to crawl away from the downturn in ‘98, we had hoped it would be the market kicking back into gear, but unfortunately, things didn’t improve much beyond that slow down.

Ever since 1992, Ross Perot has become a thorn in our sides all the same, though heralding some weird amalgamation of our own values mixed with Democrat economic stances; a sort of Populist jambalaya combining the Welfare State with America-First doctrine, and yet it’s somehow the fastest growing political organization in America!

 USA_quayles_biggest_failure_desc:0 "We’ve sat in an almost undisputed power hold for almost 130 years; we had our hiccups during the Depression and a few times throughout the last century, but this is different; this is far more drastic of a loss. Rather than trying to cement our dominance, to discredit the Reformists and strike the Democrats while they’re down, Quayle stumbles and stutters his way through public events, and refuses to take the aggressive stance against our opponents. We’re watching our supremacy wane, and no matter who approaches Quayle about the issue, he just doubles down! He calls it “not ruffling feathers,” even though he neglects the feathers were ruffled long ago, and if he’s not going to act, soon our own party’s feathers will be ruffled right out of Capitol Hill!"

This is the moment that will define the next decade, whether the Uneasy ‘90s continues onwards, or if America can make the rebound... Or worse, if she’ll fall further."
