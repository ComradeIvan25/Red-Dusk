 ussr_intro.1.d:0 "“It had been less than 10 years from that fateful day, August 19th, 1991. The moment those tanks rolled into Moscow, nobody knew that we would be changing history; nobody understood the gravity of the situation at hand, of the unfolding events that would change the very course of Russia's path. The day that it all went down, and the week that followed, would come to define us; define our glorious Union; define our situation for the foreseeable future. It was the August Coup. Our forces had moved with great haste and swift prejudice--we couldn’t watch as our glorious Motherland died, we simply couldn’t stand by and watch as it all came apart, and so we did as any reasonable men in our situation would do: we took charge of the problem at hand, and we struck it down.”\n\nYanayev was correct in many ways of his assumption of how it had all played out, how the August Coup had been a kind of saving-grace, last hurrah of sorts from the Old Guard of the Communist Party, how it had, at least for now, preserved the status quo of the Soviet Union. While there was no Stalinist revival, the Yanayev regime certainly wasn’t the most amiable with Gorbachev’s open arms towards the insidious influences of the Capitalist, Imperialist West. Yanayev and the Old Guard couldn’t sit idly by and watch as the man of little reservations walked all over the spitting image of Lenin’s great experiment, the project to redeem the proletariat! And so the Coup went through, and for the first time in Russian history, it seemed that, for once, military actions hadn’t progressed or regressed the nation--everything stood still, as if time itself had frozen around the nation. The reforms came to a halt, certainly, but Yanayev knew a moderate hand was necessary to guide the course of the storm and prevent the total breakdown of the country, and seemingly it had worked out... Of course, that was what he had originally thought.\n\nWhen we had committed to the movement, when we had put our support behind the Coup, we knew there would be consequences, some as dire as member states leaving, an economic shock, a political upheaval--but then and now did we know we could deal with it all, one by one, step by step if need be. And yet here we stood, a nation hobbling its way along with one foot in an open grave, a red not so vibrant as the triumphant revolutionary it had once been. Where was Marx's sunrise? Our Glorious Red Star?"

 ussr_intro.2.t:0 "Our Biggest “Failures”"
 ussr_intro.2.d:0 "How could the Monolith that was our glorious, Communist society fail, the greatest, freest, most fair system in the world? Well, as it turns out, throwing a Government Bureaucracy through a Military Coup that replaces the entire strata of said Bureaucracy with new faces primarily based on yes-men and political affluents, there’s a good bit of slowing to be had. When Gorbachev first took office, and when he started implementing his reforms, Yanayev claims to have seen it for what it was--Capitalism with another name, a mock attempt at the abomination created in Beijing by the Dengist regime. And though they were working at least for the time, Yanayev knew that to preserve the Socialist Model he’d have to act quickly to bring it all to a halt. Well, to do that, he had to do a small bit of economic remodeling; some tariffs here, business blocking there, and of course go through with almost returning to a military budget proportional to the Second World War.\n\nYanayev, a Military Man himself, with backing from the Military Industrial Complex, had many faces to appease in the wake of the coup, and to do that would cost him, and more importantly the Moscow treasuries, a large sum to both bolster and rebuff our friends in the Armed Forces; men who demanded larger salaries, men who demanded that we return to an “on-guard” position in the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, men who even began demanding that we kickstart a new phase of the Cold War to try and harness the economy. While the Military Industrial Complex does have its charms, and for several years provided many numerous jobs, we eventually ran out of production necessities: we had all the ammunition, tanks, aircraft we could ever need, even with NATO’s imperialist fingers crawling their way into Eastern Europe, and soon enough, the jobs started to fall through, while the spending kept going: Yanayev knew that once he lost the support of his allies in the military, it was all over, as there would be yet another internal power struggle, now with everyone being armed to the teeth.\n\nThe sudden influx of unemployment into the market was of course offset by the brilliant genius of our Economic Mastery, the Controlled Economy allowing us to assign jobs and duties, but by some work of the West, it hasn’t done much to improve things. We haven’t fallen, per say, but we haven’t progressed either; the economy is in a clear bout of stagnation, a several-year long period of a failure to advance the wellbeing of a population growingly unsettled with the reverting of all of Gorbachev’s work. Now we’re looking down the barrel of both the economy and the military..."

 ussr_intro.3.t:0 "The Elephant(s) in the Room"
 ussr_intro.3.d:0 "With a growingly discontented population, a stagnating economy, fragile political balance, and a worriedly skewed global order, the last thing the Union needed right now was a massive, internalized political struggle over the Chairman’s favor and position.\n\nAnd thus that’s exactly what we’ve been facing since 1991. When you overthrow a popular government via military means, overturn the entire economic direction of the nation, and start meddling with names like “Glasnost” and “Perestroika,” you’re bound to ruffle some feathers, feathers that are attached to vultures and predators alike, men who will gladly tear us apart from the inside to gain power and see out their own sick, twisted vision of our glorious Union.\n\nMen from the military, for instance, hold some of the scariest influence of the lot simply because they hold sway both over the Armed Forces, and more worryingly, over Yanayev himself. The “Militarist Faction,” led by one Marshal Dmitry Yazov, the Militarists’ powers derive from their economic grapple over the Military Industrial Complex, and because they control the very entity that helped Gennady Yanayev take control in the first place--what Yazov says comes with a friendly attached letter that will gladly and openly put into fresh words “or else,” which though not literal haunts the General Secretary day by day. A traditionalist of the Soviet system, Yazov and his gang are not to be underestimated... Not all “Good Soldiers” follow orders.\n\nEven the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet wasn’t safe, with men like Boris Pugo, Secretary of the Interior, working at his own goals to see the USSR rebuilt in an image that was almost mirrored by his former compatriot and the late Secretary, Yuri Andropov; a plan to return to the strongly command economic system, a crackdown on internal dissent and corruption, a strong yet anti-war approach to America and the NATO snakes. While the military holds sway due to its might, Pugo and his cronies exercise their strength by how close they sit to Yanayev. Some keep friends close and enemies closer; when the lines are blurred on who’s who, that becomes a much more risky game of cat and mouse.\n\nLet’s not forget to add on to the pile our good friend, the former Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, who’s still out there--still writing books, still playing hardball even when he’s no longer in Moscow politics. And somehow, he commands respect from the people, OUR people! How does this has-been that we threw out of office nearly ten years ago still somehow bring these people to rise? Well, that may come down to policy, but Yanayev will never admit that giving people greater political and economic autonomy is the driving force there... Gorbachev is still a danger, though, and should never be seen as a nobody. He poses a threat almost as great as the “upstart.”\n\nThat upstart just so happens to originate from the KGB, a young and spry man, head of the organization for that matter. He would happen to be Vladimir-"

 ussr_intro.4.d:0 "Yanayev could not sit on his laurels forever; the Union is facing some of the worst issues it has faced since the Spring of ‘56, and things don’t seem to be improving. With the economy in shambles, the political landscape of the nation on the brink of tossing Russia into yet another mad dash for power, and with the world staring at Moscow waiting for a response, the aging Chairman is starting to feel the weight of not only Russia, but the entire globe, barreling down on his shoulders. He’ll be turning 63 this year, and all of the stress from the coup, from the failing policy, from his inability to act given he had to play nice with so many internal factions, the public outcry, the mounting diplomatic forces, was perhaps too much for his frail shoulders to bear anymore.\n\nHow much longer could little Gennady keep at the game? How much longer could he try in desperation to carry on the mantle of Marx, of Comrades Lenin and Stalin? Frankly, even he didn’t know the answer to that question. He was an old man with enemies on all sides, enemies masquerading as friends, and friends acting like enemies. He was stuck, he was suffering, and with him so too was the Soviet Union stuck and suffering. There would be no quiet recovery, there couldn’t be any way to fix these issues by sitting back and praying for the best--Russia didn’t just need a hero, it needed a Savior, and for the first time in his life, Yanayev was starting to doubt his abilities to carry that title. Could he, could anyone, really save Russia at this point?\n\nWith the factions mounting up for the coming Party Meetings, and with the entire nation sitting on the edges of their seats, waiting in anticipation for an answer from the Kremlin, it would all come down to this. The Chairman’s position was crumbling around him, Russia, though only stagnating now, showed no signs that recovery was on the horizon. We’ve tried our best to keep it all together, but it’s coming to a point where even we don’t know what the future holds for our beloved Union. Another coup? An economic Depression? Or God forbid, a total collapse?\n\nThe Cold War has not simply been a battle of nations, a battle of values, or even a battle of ideologies; it’s been a struggle for the very fate of the Earth, time and time again, where men, for reasons even they do not at times comprehend, will put everything on the line over one, big, red button, a button that could bring about the end of times, the end of mankind itself. These were the horrifying realities we were facing, and for once, we couldn’t hide it under propaganda, under dissidence suppression.\n\nWhere was our Red Star?"

We’ve already lost some member states to secessions in the wake of the coup, we’ve already lost our economy to the flow of stagnation, and seemingly we’ve already lost the will of our people. How can we hope to win? How can we survive?\n\nWe’ll have to figure it out one way or another. We cannot give in, we cannot surrender, we cannot accept defeat laying down! We bear the mantle of Stalin, of all the workers of the world; we beat the Nazis, we beat the Capitalists to the Stars; we beat their God, we beat their will, we’ve beat their way of life, and now all we need is the home push to prove it! Assuredly, it isn’t all propaganda, it isn’t all hopeful dreamings and rantings... Right?\n\nThe United States too has faced her own peril in recent years, surely that’s a sign! The Europeans and their filthy Union have failed to gain major traction in the Eastern Bloc, that’s definitely a sign they wish to return to their friends in Red Square! NATO hasn’t invaded yet, that too is a great success, and we still hold our seats on the United Nations security council, so obviously we’re still a capable and strong nation! Right?... Right?"

 ussr.1.d:0 "It has been a cold morning in Moscow, the New Year celebrations have passed, the entire Union entered the 21st century. However it didn't really feel like anything special, the old problems still remained, Union's policies didn't change and neither did the global political situation. But to some people like Mikhail, a worker in one of Moscow's many factories, political situation mattered very little. He would get up in the morning, have breakfast with his wife and kids and take a walk to his workplace.\n\nAs he walked down Moscow streets, he could see people walk by him, children, elderly, police officers, workers and many more. Truth be told, everyone felt the exhaustion of the economic stagnation, Gorbachev's and Yanayev's failed reforms and more than 50 years of the Cold War with the west. As he looked he could see that not everyone was happy but were grateful that at the very least, the dreaded Gorbachev era breadlines were gone. Still, no one was very pleased with the current situation either.\n\n"Mikhail, it's so good to see you." -  A voice spoke out from behind.\n\n"Ah Seryozha, it's good to see you too. But what are you doing here? Don't you take a bus every morning to work?" - Mikhail asked his friend and co-worker Seryozha.\n\n"Had to go to store to buy bread and some other stuff. I was looking for some detergent for 15 whole minutes, only to be told that there are none in stock." - Seryozha answered.\n\n"Really, it is that bad?" - Mikhail asked his friend.\n\n"Yeah. Not a lot of choices yet so little in stock. I am guessing they either have problems with supply system or perhaps they stopped making those detergents. Either way, I found another one so it wasn't a big issue. If this continues we might as well go back to the breadlines." - Seryozha said."

Further, the new head of the army is Dimitry Yazov, a feared and capable man that will lead the reformed Soviet Army. The new head of the KGB is a promising young man named Vladimir Putin, and he will be instrumental to the Soviet Union.

Blockades, sanctions, and economic wars have been imposed on us by the West for over 50 years now. All of them with one goal: to cripple us. Sad to say that it appears that they are working. The Union's only future is to either reform or vanish. Our over-militarized economy is of no help either. As much as we can show our teeth to the West, if we cannot take care of our people first, it will lead to a disaster. We will have to do some reforming or the Union of the People will not last."

Yanayev, General Secretary of the Soviet Union for the past decade and one of the instigators of the coup that saved the USSR, has resigned. Members of the Politburo were in shock but also very nervous. The moment they were waiting for came, as with Yanayev gone, it is finally their chance to become leaders of the Soviet Union.

But in the end the meeting has been prolonged.\n\nThis was an opportunity two very optimistic men in the hall were waiting.\n\nIn the sudden and unexpected move, old reformer Mikhail Gorbachev, tought to have been completely cut from politics, raised from all the members and announced his plan to candidate for the leader of the USSR. It was no surprise to some who knew that the Politburo has rehabilitated him back into politics after he was pronounced to have changed his way and views.\n\nThe second one was Vladimir Putin, current head of the KGB and a promising new rising star of the party. The speaker was informed about his candidacy by a KGB officer present in the hall.  Putin had powerful friends everywhere and was favoured to win.\n\nAnd once again final voting begun and the next leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is..."

The Colonel  soon made his way in-front of Yazov, and gave him a salute, before, rather coldly saying; \n\n"It is done." \n\nNow, just saying "It is done" would not mean much to many, but knowing his own orders lately, it was rather clear what had happened. Gorbachev was dead. Now, if all went to plan, it would be a murder by some unknown hard-conservative, if not, well, there would not be enough evidence to say whatever either way. Yazov stood up, giving Putin the salute, and simply, gesturing to the door. Sitting back down, Yazov continued working on the documents, but relieved. The enemies, of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet way of life, were meeting their end. And one way, or the other, all would share the fate of Gorbachev.

Looking at the clock, only then did he realize it was well past midnight. Almost 20 hours without sleep, for what? Another failure. He just sighed and taught to himself. How old were all the other General Secretaries before him, perhaps it was time for him to finally consider retirement. After all, Party could decide who could replace him, maybe Krychkov could come out of retirement and take temporary leadership until the Party sorts itself out. Still he couldn't really leave it empty, besides main players like Pugo and Yazov, there were many more, ready to tear each other apart as soon as he either resigned or kicked the bucket. But whatever he was thinking in that moment was quickly dashed aside as soon as one of the officers entered.\n\n"Comrade Yanayev. I am delivering a letter from comrade Gennady Zyuganov. He requested that this letter be urgently sent to you." - Officer said.\n\nYanayev took the letter into his hands and then dismissed the officer. Opening it, he didn't know what to expect but there was a feeling that it couldn't be anything good. Letter was rather simple, written by hand even, instead on a machine or computer. Besides normal greetings there was a rather troublesome part.\n\n"Besides regular bickering in the Party, many of my close friends and comrades have brought me troubling information that some elements of the Party are considering your removal due to, as they state 'failures of reforms and overall leadership'. Some consider this to be voted on the next Party congress, while some, more radical consider it to be done trough, to put it simply, more harsh way."\n\nYanayev sat there, in total silence as he re-read the entire paragraph again and again. This can't be, he knew Party was displeased with his actions but going as far as to repeat the whole coup was just absurd. He just dropped the letter and stood up to look outside of the window as he quietly said to himself:"

 ussr.34.t:0 "A Bitter Truth"
 ussr.34.d:0 "Dread, anxiousness and fear could be the best words to describe what Yanayev was feeling at the moment of the Party Congress. He knew that it would soon be his time to address not only the Party but the entire Union itself. What was he going to say, how was he going to say it? How can the leader who promised the salvation for all people of the Union go onto the stand and say that the Party, the military, hell the entire Union itself is corrupt to the core. How could he do that... Those thoughts soon vanished when he realised that it was his turn to speak. Now was the time to speak bitter truth.\n\n"Comrades...as we all know. The entire Union has entered the new millennium. This is both a great success but also...." - He stopped mid sentence to once more go trough his own thoughts. - "...a great challenge, not only for the Party but also for the nation."\n\nHe continued his speech like everyone would expect, normal, boring, almost similar to anything Brezhnev would have said. But all of the sudden he stopped, put his paper down and took off his glasses.\n\n"However, as I have to sadly mention. The Party itself is, as I believe, not ready. We are not ready. This new century brings new difficulties, and taking the corruption, distrust and quiet frankly, betrayals into account - I believe the Party itself is not ready for the future ahead of it." - As he finished this sentence, the entire building suddenly went silent. Many were shocked, some even silently angry about Yanayev's speech. You could see that both the KGB, reformists and militarists were displeased with the situation in the Party but also with Yanayev's boldness to exclaim it to the world.\n\n"But I believe that if we put enough effort, we will return the Party to the righ course. We must not abandon the teachings of Marx and Lenin. The Union must be strong and so must we!" - He finished his speech with a rather optimistic tone. "

Our best chance is to invest into the eastern Europe and begin influencing their politics." - One of Gorbachev's economic ministers counter-argued.\n\nGorbachev once again, sat in the middle of this whole ordeal and simply listened. He was unsure.\n\nMaybe generals were right. Swift army offensive could perhaps prevent any and all NATO influences in the east but they can also bring more problems in the long run. We could face more resistance from the small, yet loud minority, just like in the 1989.\n\nOn the other hand, economic and political influence could take time and even just straight up hand over some ex-Warsaw Pact countries to the USA.

 usa.1.d:0 "With the Soviet Union hobbling its way towards the 21st Century on its last legs, the Cold War had seemed all but over; the Americans watched as the Eastern Bloc ran off in its own, separate direction; watched as the Soviet’s allies began to receive less and less support from Moscow; watched as the dreaded Bear of the East slowly began to enter a permanent hibernation. And yet, for all intents and purposes, for some reason, it didn’t–it was weakened, certainly, but not dead by any means. The Soviet Union would live on, and the American political rings from all sides began to feel the shockwave of this revelation by early 1992. \n\nNo one was quite expecting the chances of Soviet survival; no one on the Left or Right thought it possible for the “Evil Empire” to retain in the world following the Coup, and the American Socialists were just as stunned that the rapidly reformed USSR had just been spun on its head, and as had their directives as political entities. The American nation hadn’t changed much because of it, but the attitude in the air wasn’t so much of “We’ve Won” but more so of “The War’s Still On.” Were the Soviets realistically a threat? Not particularly. Were the American people still on guard? Indeed. Reagan had sown the seeds of what many hoped was an end to the Cold War, and now, it seemed that his labors were just the beginning of the continued fight to put down the Bear. The spirit of the American nation would not be able to allow itself to put down its guard; it couldn’t accept the weakness of the Bear as a reason to finally let down their ethos that the Red Menace need be crushed at all costs. Though, unfortunately for the United States as a whole, not everyone quite agreed that the fight needed to go on, and instead began to wage a new war. \n\nThat fight would begin in the greatest tipping point in American History since the Civil War; a colossal shift in domestic and foreign policy that culminated with the devastatingly small margin, both sides were so close, so edged against one another, that for generations to come, the year 1992 would become the hotspot of a new battle within Washington itself; the Left and Right had come head to head in an internal contest to test the path of America, and to decide the fate of the Cold War, and thus, the fate of the world. And thus, 1992 would become host to..."

 usa.2.d:0 "When 1992 came to pass, November Elections were growingly a to-be tense battle for all sides involved; the Republicans under incumbent, 41st President George H.W. Bush had been reeling from a mixed bag of successes–now complicated by an Economic Recession that seemingly only accentuated the President’s reneging on his promises to raise no taxes while in office; the Democrats had stepped forth with Arkansas Governor William “Bill” J. Clinton, a widely popular man of the people who sought to finally put an end to the Cold War’s spending frenzy, and coexist with the dying Soviet Union in a more peaceful world; out of the blue, an up-and-coming Texas Multimillionaire too decided to throw his hat into the Presidential ring, that being Ross Perot and his to-be-declared Reform Party, standing as a strong third option against the Democrats and Republicans for internal change across the board. All three sides had their issues, all three had their strengths, but none of them could rightly predict the outcome of the elections to come–simply by the density of the concern in the air. \n\nBush’s image had certainly been tarnished, but his Cold War efforts seemed all the more necessary as of the rise of the hostile regime under Yanayev’s more traditionally Soviet-style dictatorship out of Moscow; Clinton had the popular face, but nowhere near the credibility, and many were skeptical of the plan to let the Soviets ride peacefully into the sunset just as they began to recover from the initial shock of the August Coup; Ross Perot was a newcomer who challenged both parties with widely demanded issues, but was, indeed, outside of the two party primacy and thus nowhere near guaranteed victory at even the state level. The Republicans were reeling, the Democrats struggling, and Perot’s gang desperately clinging to whatever support they could get, and it all began to culminate together into one of if not the most tense elections of the 20th Century, not just in America, but globally. \n\nThe election was for all intents and purposes up in the air, even up until the night of, and no one quite knew what was going to happen between the popular vote or even the Electoral College–there was even blurring of the lines over how the states would vote. When voting began on November 3rd, results struggled to be tallied until early in the morning on the 4th, when every television, radio, and speaker in America blared out, before crowds of millions in bated breath..."

The Democrats as of this time had lost a good bit of their traditional support basin to Perot’s economically social platform and the Republican Party’s avidly Anti-Communist sentiments, both of which resonating in Democrat controlled Southern States, who still voted with far more Socially-Conservative issues in mind, allowing Bush with the far stronger ticket to sweep up several of Clinton’s southern Allies, despite being a Northerner, and was even able to tag a couple dozen delegates out of the Rust Belt with his efforts to continue to back war-based industries following his excursions in Iraq and Kuwait. Recounts, while triggered, failed to give Bill the victory he had desired, but it had revealed something rather appalling to the American people... \n\nBush had failed to win the Popular vote by around a million votes, and yet was able to barely by only two electoral college votes win the Presidency. This was not particularly aided when the Reform party would grab itself a foundation in New England, where Ross Perot, despite being a Southerner in Northern lands, had made a name for himself as the man with a plan; a balance between Republicans and Democrats, and an option that wasn’t too far in either direction. This outcome, overall, put America on a rather unstable path, and the following months were just as tumultuous. \n\nOn January 20th, when Bush was for a second time inaugurated as the United States President, almost half of the Crowd was not there out of support, but a massive protest numbering nearly 50,000 people strong, who would engage in a rather controversial “march” across the city that resulted in the burnings of several American flags, a Police Standoff with Protestors outside of the White House, and nearly five hundred arrests of for Civil Disobedience, Reckless Endangerment, and one for attempting to bludgeon a Police Officer.

That never really came. Just when everyone thought the American nation was on the brink of massive rioting, the chaos seemingly just stopped out of nowhere. The protesters all left en-masse in droves, the Republican party had refused to openly publicize the event as an attack on the President, and even the Media had quickly attempted to move on from the events. It was as though it had never happened, and yet, the tensions still hanged in the air. \n\nThis era was in no way for the American nation particularly bountiful and prosperous, but at the same time neither was it violent and bloody; while the odd riot or two still broke out in the cities between members of both the Left and Right, the decade itself didn’t follow in the trend of the January Riots. Instead, it followed more the aftermath; no one knew entirely how to feel, and the entire nation entered into a sort of gray zone, an imbalance in the universe itself as the entirety of America sat by for the ride. The tensions around every citizen were palpable, as though one could reach out and grab it, and yet it never came–no great eruption, no horrible collapse. Time simply moved on, and no one could entirely believe it. \n\nPresident Bush would continue to fight on for the next four years of his term in office, watching the Soviet’s every move, building relations in the former Eastern Bloc nations, and even working to oversee the reconstruction of Germany following a period of unrest in the reintegrated East. Bush would use these successes as a cudgel of sorts coming into the 1996 elections, with his popular Vice President Dan Quayle taking up the Republican ballot, and the victory in the end with 282 electoral college votes and 41% of the popular vote; Clinton ran again despite only barely beating out fellow Democrat Lyndon LaRouche at the primaries, and entering into the General elections faced a major blowout with only about 27% of the Popular Vote, and 181 Electoral College votes; Ross Perot on the other hand had advanced his position to taking 32% of the popular vote, securing all of New England, and a large portion of the California voting base. \n\nWith Three parties in the Senate and Congress by the end of the decade, the government had been rather much slowed down; an inability to respond appropriately to many issues, the emergence of Tripartisan politics, and the struggle to find a solution to the Soviet issue had left America in a position of indecisiveness. The Government by 1997 was now feeling the full effect that the nation itself had felt; division that did not tear asunder; a break in the chain and yet the continued march of progress.

The Economic bubble looming on the horizon as well as the jubilance of the New Year had helped to shake off most of the unrest and indecisiveness among the public, but there were still many skeptical voices in the face of what seemed to be the next torch thrown wildly into the darkness of the unknown. \n\nWith the Soviet Union still trudging along, with the Government divided as ever, and with NATO starting to grow more and more fed up with American practices up to this point, all eyes were now turning on to the Land of the Free to get off the ground and start marching. Johnny came marching home from far worse, surely this wouldn’t be the end of the Yanks, and surely they would come out swinging, right? Surely this was the moment when the Star Spangled Banner flew bravely in the air, on land, and sea? Well... No one really knew, least so the Americans.

 usa_quayle.4.d:0 "Rather than recover, the pain only got worse and worse by the day; it had been years since it started, but for some reason it just wasn’t stopping; the pills, the medication, the massages and the compression all had failed to stop the deep, throbbing pain in his legs. The doctors said he’d be fine, said he’d have no issue with it as time went on, but then why in Christ’s holy name were they still burning?!\n\nThe itch wouldn’t go away, the inflammation never went down, and the red spot coursing across his thigh never seemingly gave in. It was as if he was suffering from someone constantly rubbing poison ivy on his legs, and yet he could never wash off the oils. If he had to suffer with it another moment, he’d probably have started screaming about the Oval office in a tizzy...\n\n“Mr. President?” A voice came in from his secretary’s room, familiar and yet muffled under his own thoughts. Quayle looked up at the door, and barked with an unenthusiastic groan “Come in” as a response. Through the door stepped a friend, a close one, the family doctor of course–did he have another prescription? Another drug...? No, he just had a stack of papers. And an oddly depressed look on his face. The President had been so busy over the past several years, moving around and taking so many damned tests that he hadn’t “seen” the man in so long that he almost didn’t recognize his face.\n\n“Dan, I’m sorry to say this to you, but your testing results came back... What started as a small affliction, well, because you never let it rest and clear up has become much more severe. Between smoking, moving around the country all the time, and the endless stress on your shoulders... Mr. President...”"

 usa_quayle.5.d:0 "Stepping before the crowd, barely able to walk without wincing, President Quayle stepped out on the White House balcony with a big wave and a bigger smile. The atmosphere was ripe, the people were in full swing, and the joy in the air was unrivaled as American flags flailed in every direction, the tens of thousands of onlookers and the dozens of Television cameras all looking at him from down on the ground. It was a beautiful sight in all ways, as it had been the past three times he’d done this exact thing... But this time was to be a little different.\n\nOf course, the main attraction was to be his fiery address about Americanism, and the Declaration, and what it means to hold your hand on your heart with a hotdog in your mouth at the Ballgame; all the usual flag-waving stuff, this was after all the celebration of Independence day, but he couldn’t quite shake the feeling of dread at what he was about to say. When the cheering finally subsided after the end of his long-winded speech about “Freedoms never Forgotten,” he finally took out his extra sheet of paper. The smile slowly crumbled off his face as he looked out at the crowd, addressing them once more with a tone one might call shaken.\n\n“Now... Today, I have one final announcement to make. It is with great pride that I have served as your...” He droned on for about ten minutes of how grateful he was to be the President, and how great the people were, and how amazing America was, yes, yes, everyone gets the message, but then he made his final statement; this one didn’t so much resonate with cheers as it did with stunned silence from some and appalled gasps from others..."

 usa_quayle.6.d:0 "Throughout the month of August, the three main parties in the United States all ran their hands in the bowl of the National Conventions, and came up with a rather... Mixed handful of candidates.\n\nThe Republicans obviously had a “fun” experience this go around; with Quayle rather suddenly and unexpectedly dropping his bid for reelection, there was a sudden demand for candidates from all wings and sides of the party, go figure, and a demand that needed to be met quickly lest the entire party fall into disarray. The Senate and House Whips got together everything the party had for the upcoming elections, and there was already contention over the main attraction, the big question that would define the party’s direction for the next while to come: Who would be our candidate?\n\nWith Quayle out, two main contenders came to the forefront of the party; obviously, there was always going to be a man with the name Bush on the stage so long as the dynasty lived on, Texas Governor George W. Bush–heir to the Bush Family legacy of Republican frontrunners. Of course, while Bush was an obvious pick for the party by merit of his name alone, he was far from uncontested; the Republican party had been gripping with itself over whether or not having Dynasties was a healthy facet for a democratically elected political entity, especially one that had just barely started to recover from the funk of the last member of such a dynasty. Though Bush had the voice and weight of a political champion of the continuation of his Father’s policies, some in the party would rather have stood behind someone a bit less rough around the edges. Someone who was less present because of a dynasty and more because of his popularity, even barring aside all conventions.\n\nThat man was of course Arizona Senator John McCain, a man who had made a name for himself as a rather bipartisan worker known for his efforts at Electoral Reform with bills that crossed over the party line to make effective change. McCain was a rather popular man, and he spoke on a very moderate platform that offered stability and compromise in a time of tension and divide, a voice that spoke not so much as stringently Republican as much as “Republican.” Which of course led to accusations that McCain was so much a true Republican as he was a chocolate milkshake–with the hardliners, Reaganites, and even the party’s more Laissez-Faire wing all decrying the man as a “Republican in Name Only.”\n\nIn the end, only one side could become the true successor to Quayle, and when the end of the Convention finally came to pass, the Republican delegates had decided to stand behind..."

Mixed handful of candidates.\n\nWhen the Democrats came together, there was the same question on the table as had at the last two elections that came to the forefront: do we put in Clinton? Clinton had been running Arkansas rather successfully for quite some time, even if only by proxy of his electorally appointed friend to the position... Not a particularly flattering position to be in for the awash candidate. And there was also the issue that he had already lost twice in a row, the second time more spectacularly than the first, and now he was only on the downhill. Losing two elections in a row and being blamed for eight more years of Republican dominance takes a heavy toll on a man, and the disheveled, growingly anxious Clinton was no longer looking as healthy of a choice to the DNC, between his growing ranting and raving, his continuous belief that someone was out to get him, and his seemingly paranoid delusion that the Bush’s had bugged his family’s home. Clinton wasn’t seemingly the man anymore for the ticket, and everyone, even his more ardent supporters, knew it. There was of course an alternative; Gore.\n\nAl Gore had run with Clinton twice for his chance at becoming the Vice President; a soft-spoken man with big plans and bigger ambitions to quite literally change the very fabric of the American nation’s economy from the ground up, running on a platform akin to that of the Greens, at least economically and environmentally. Environmental regulations, funding to fight Climate Change, a shift away from American heavy-industry in the burgeoning age of technology, Gore was seemingly the radical the Democrats needed to shake up the grounds that had become soiled with complacency.\n\nHe had the face, he had the plans, but did he have the support? He, like Clinton, had just lost two elections in a row, and the Democrats hadn’t been much for dipping their toes in meddling with the jobs of American industrial workers, especially since much of their vote came from the blue-collar working class up until very recently, and more so because of how fragile it seemed the American economy was at the time. Gore’s chances of victory were far from guaranteed, even if he were to win the Conventions.\n\nGore would have to fight, but with the backing of Connecticut Democrat Joe Lieberman, there was just a chance he could work it all out; Quayle’s departure could just break the armor of the Republican Party, and he was the best they had on the stage at the time of the votes. And thus, the Democrats had decided..."

Mixed handful of candidates.\n\nThe Reform Party of all three parties had the hardest choice with their candidates; namely because they had so damned many of them! Rather than the Democrats with their one major frontrunner, and the Republicans with a rather restricted menu, the Reform party had neither a long-standing political position, or a political candidate from a long line to choose from; they were a young party, and Perot himself hadn’t ordained any official successors in the wake of his growing age and distance from direct political involvement. There was quite a bit of contention then between the Left and the Right wing of the party; the moderates and the radicals; a hodgepodge of politics.\n\nOn one hand, Conservative Patrick Buchanan was a strong frontrunner for the party, with a history behind him of being an advocate for the Republicans for much of his life, though was now disillusioned with the Quayle administration after it took a turn away from the Reagan era conservatism he was so attached to. There was also John Hagelin, who worked on behalf of the American branch of the Transcendental Meditation movement, which was based on the pseudo-religious teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. And then to round it all off, there was New York Playboy, multimillionaire and businessman Donald J. Trump, a television personality who was known for his own brand of steaks, vodka, and his highrise towers, but also for being a stark advocate for the Perot plan and its continued implementation. Alongside several other minor members, the Reform party itself was a disorganized and unstructured mess of ideologies, beliefs, systems, and of course direction.\n\nOf the three frontrunners for the party, Buchanan and Trump were the only serious candidates, and the backrunners of the party ranging from open Communists to full on Neo-Nazis didn’t get in much edgewise, which at the very least helped to concentrate the party on something for once, but even then the battle was neck-at-neck. While Buchanan had the political legacy to back up his claim, many doubted how committed he was to the Reform ticket due to his Republican past, and Trump’s sudden jump onto the political stage left him short of legitimacy due to his past as a hipster and a trendsetter more than a politician, known more for wrestling and steaks than anything else. And yet, both ran on strong tickets; both held ideas popular with the American people, at least within the party, and it was close all the way up until the final curtain call, when finally the delegates announced..."

This was supposedly meant to be a make-or-break moment for the nation, and despite it all, the President knew that this was going to be some flavor of disastrous. And he wasn’t wrong. The day went by slowly at first, but as time went on, things seemingly got worse and worse; the polls were all over the place, many states took hours longer than predicted to get proper counts on their votes, and some accusations of fraudulent voting went around in Florida over the punch-cards they used, though these were quickly settled in legal battles over the course of the next few weeks.\n\nThe day came, and the day went, because, frankly, there was nothing to be said on that day: the counts were taking too long to call on election day alone, and the battle for the vote, through the courts, through the Electoral College, and finally the media, was rife with conflict and elongated beyond reasonability. The results for the states were none too surprising, and even the electoral college didn’t give too much of a shock, but the popular vote was all over the place! Many states even began to question the ballots once they’d realized that in many of the swing states, it was an almost even three way split. Convention had been thrown out the window quite a while back with the previous election, but things seemingly were devolving more and more into crazed delirium as time went on.\n\nBut of course, things eventually did get straight enough for an answer to be produced; it was an unpopular answer, it would have to be, as the votes seemingly were stacked against any singular candidate, with none being able to win out the solid majority, but able to win out a partial set over one another. The people waited on the edges of their seats, and the Senate waited at the edge of their patience, as the electoral college cast the last of its votes. Down to the last second, the election was all but in the air, but the final call came through in the end. The winner of the 2000 presidential election, by narrow margin, was..."

The elections were over, and the nation was chomping at the bit to get things swinging with the new President.\n\nIt was a warm enough day, even for January, and the buzzing of the crowd made it seem all that much warmer when George Bush stepped out of the Presidential Limo, Quayle trailing behind, walker in hand, ready to see his successor be sworn in.

In fact, they’ve been one of the only major producers since their victory in the so-called “Browser Wars” with their well-known search engine, Internet Explorer, crushing all other competitors by use... They’ve been fighting for three years in the Supreme Court because of this.\n\nIt was alleged back in 1998 that Microsoft had been violating Antitrust laws by packaging their revolutionary browsing software with their Operating System, giving it a definitive edge that allowed them to trounce all who opposed them in the Browser Wars, ruffling enough feathers to cause a debate big enough to involve the Supreme Court, brought on by the Department of Defense. Now, after the initial ruling demanding Microsoft be broken up, as well as the affirmation that Microsoft had been acting with the powers of a Monopolist, the Supreme Court has finally overseen a proper settlement.\n\nForcing Microsoft to share its “Application Programming Interfaces,” CEO Bill Gates’ total dominance over the market of the internet has, supposedly, been broken--whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain, the Internet is a battleground, and the Government has just set her boots into the frontline."

However, according to the President, the little nation was not only rather beautiful when he first stepped foot on the tarmac, but also could be the staging grounds for opening new diplomatic channels to the Soviet Union.\n\nFor the time being, however, the President’s visit was merely for meetings with Armenia, who the US was eager to continue to promote the beneficial relations that his father had opened with the nation, due to their strategic location in the Cold War’s new balance.

 vin_intro.1.d:0 "Vietnam is located in a region considered a cradle of mankind, one of the earliest agricultural centers practicing wet rice farming, where the stone and metallurgical revolutions took place.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Western capitalist countries entered the period of imperialism and colonialism. Through missionaries and trade, the French gradually dominated Vietnam. For the first time in history, Vietnam had to cope with the invasion of a Western industrial country. In that context, some Vietnamese intellectuals were aware of the need to carry out reforms, bringing the country out of stagnation and save national independence. Many reform plans were proposed, yet rejected by the Nguyen Dynasty. Subsequently, the country was driven into backwardness and deadlock and became a semi-feudal colony for nearly 100 years from 1858 to 1945.\n\nThe founding of the Communist Party of Vietnam on 3 February 1930 was an important milestone in the Vietnamese history. In August 1945, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people successfully launched an uprising to seize power and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam came into being on 2 September 1945.\n\nThe newly founded Vietnam had to go through another 30-year-long struggle for national liberation and reunification. Dien Bien Phu victory and Geneva Accord in 1954 put an end to the war of resistance against the French colonialists. According to the Accord, the country was temporarily separated along the 17th Parallel North into two territories, North Vietnam and the South Vietnam, which were expected to be reunified two years later with a general election. South Vietnam was ruled by a pro-French and then pro-USA government in Saigon. Though Saigon regime attempted to prevent reunification, it failed to subdue peace and national reunification campaigns. As a result, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam was founded on December 20 1964.\n\nBetween 1954 and 1975, Vietnam had to stand up for national liberation and unification. To support the South Vietnam regime, the US sent military aid and over half a million soldiers to Vietnam, and started bombing North Vietnam in 1964. To fulfill President Ho Chi Minh’s apiration that "nothing is more precious than independence and freedom", the Vietnamese people experienced untold hardship and sacrifice. In 1973, the Paris Accord was signed for restoration of peace in Vietnam and withdrawal of the US troops. The war came to an end in spring 1975 as the patriotic armed forces launched an offensive against the Saigon regime, liberated southern Vietnam and reunified the country. Since then, the unified Vietnam has ushered into a new era of peace, unification and national construction. Democratic Republic of Vietnam was renamed Socialist Republic of Vietnam on April 25 1976."

Our army and people have defeated U.S imperialism and the Saigon puppet regime; gloriously ended the 30-year war for independence, freedom, and reunification of the Fatherland; put an end to more than a century of oppression by imperialism.\n\nIt is a shining milestone in the history of mankind's struggle for freedom. The victory of the Vietnamese people contributes to promoting the struggle of people around the world for the sake of national independence, peace, democracy, and social progress; cheering and encouraging the nations that are carrying out national liberation and anti-neocolonialism."

In a moment his whole world went quiet while he was trying to realise what had happened. He could see people in civilian clothes with guns opening fire on the brigade HQ. He could also see his fellow soldiers firing back or getting killed in the process. But he just stood there, almost like he was frozen in time, until his fellow soldier pulled him down into the trench. He couldn't see much but he could hear an intense firefight.\n\nIt probably lasted less than 10 minutes but to him it seemed like an eternity. And then it stopped.

State of emergency has been issues, military and police are either in the streets or are heading towards the unclear front lines. The first days of this war have been confusing, dramatic and overall unclear. Nobody knew what this was or how to react.\n\nSome feared that if ANC won, they would suffer the consequences of Viljoen's doings while many wished and dreamed of freedom that was now possible to achieve. It was clear that this war will touch everyone one way or another and decisions had to be made. There was no longer neutral or peaceful, now it could be only one:"

 saf.9.d:0 "After the ban on ANC and imposed martial law in South Africa, the internal situation of the nation is pretty tense and hectic. There are various pro-ANC uprisings occurring throughout the nation which has been challenging to the SATF to deal with.\n\nSHOCKING REPORT\n\nAccording to a South African Media Network, the military base at Durban, in the Kwazulu-Natal Province has been subjected to a 'suspected terror attack by an anonymous group of pro-ANC militias'. This attack has been reported to be conducted post-midnight when most of the soldiers were asleep in their blocks and the security was minimised. According to the CCTV footage, a group of dozen militias with arms, heavy ammunitions and grenades breached the wire fencing of the eastern bloc of the base and started to open fire towards the personnel quarters. 3 simultaneous grenade explosions were reported during the terror attack. Till the reinforcements could arrive, it was too late. The militants had fled after creating havoc in the base. The total number of casualty has still not been disclosed by the military officials. Many have been injured and an officer had died due to the attack. A high level investigation is to be launched by the military cabinet for the cause. ANC's proclaimed Commander, Solly Shoke is suspected to be the mastermind behind this terrorist attack. Commander Viljoen has given condolences to the families of the fallen eagles."

 saf.11.t:0 "The Junta Stays"
 saf.11.d:0 "During the talks with the members of the South African parliament, Constand Viljoen, the leader of the South African military junta, and his collaborators demonstrated to the members of parliament that the ANC is still very much a threat to the political stability of South Africa. During this speech he mentioned that even after the death of Nelson Mandela, the insurgency against the South African government and the apartheid system hasn't stopped, but only intensified, and for this reason the military rule must remain. After a few minutes of silence from the members of parliament, Viljoen continued his speech noting that the parliament building has been secured by military forces more loyal to him and the army command, thus strongly implying that if the parliament made any kind of mistake like trying to collaborate with the ANC or try to limit the power of the military,  he would be forced to intervene.\n\nThe members of the South African Parliament, worried about a possible coup d'etat or even their arrests on false charges had to accept Viljoen's request."

It wasn't even 7 in the morning and the port as well as many city pubs were active, filled with some sailors, off duty soldiers and old folks.\n\nSuch was the morning for two old soldiers, veterans of the Angolan war and most of all, close friends. William and Abdu. Both different in political beliefs, skin colour and status, but bound by comradeship and alcohol. They met each other just like every morning, sat down and ordered their drinks. After greetings were done they moved onto other topics, family stories, memories of serving in the army etc. Until the conversation finally landed onto the topic of politics. It was clear that two were very different in this field.\n\n"I am not sure Abdu. This whole situation we got here is...complex to say the least. But I think that the old bastard Viljoen is the best choice we got. He's not the best but at least we can live normally." - said William.\n\n"Speak for yourself. I am the black one here. Well, at least serving in the army got me a better position in life. But that still doesn't excuse that the apartheid is still here. Hell, maybe Parliament guys have a point, they aren't all that better but maybe they are the only grace to save this country from an open civil war." - Abdu remarked.\n\n"I don't think so, but who gives a damn about our opinions." - William said as he begun drinking his beer.\n\n"You are right. I just hope it will be better, but as long as the pension is on time and I can drink with you, I am happy." - Abdu said before picking his bottle."
 saf.12.a:0 "Aye, I'll drink to that."

Our politics and opinions on racial issues of South Africa may be different, but one thing unites us - will to fight the British colonisers, or in this case, the South African government.\n\nThis was one of the topics that was talked about on the meeting of ANC's leaders. Many were in favour of seeking Boer support, while others were against it, citing that the Boers themselves were colonisers. Ultimately, the fate of this agreement fell into an unpredictable and quick vote. Will we sacrifice our goal to some extent so that we can secure military support? Or will we stick to it, even tough it will clearly damage our plans of ending this war quickly?\n\nUltimately, the vote was clear:"

Not even apartheid touched him since he lived in a more remote area of the country with only contact to the society for him being a trip to a grocery shop.\n\nAs he finally finished his morning rest, he stood up and prepared himself for a 2 kilometer walk to the same town he visited every few days. The sun wasn't at it's peak since it was still early morning and the road was empty as always with only a few military vehicles passing him once. He could hear the soldiers make racist remarks to him but he wasn't bothered. He had only one task and he was going to do it.\n\nAs he made his way to the town outskirts an explosion destroyed a a military convoy that was park in the town square. Banele took cover in a nearest ditch, he covered his ears and hoped that this whole ordeal would pass as fast as possible.\n\nAfter peaking his head out of the ditch after a few minutes, he could clearly see that some buildings were engulfed in flames, but there were no soldiers present. Silence fell onto the town as if nothing had even happened. He got out of the ditch and made his way to the town square where he could clearly see dead soldiers on the ground and a group of what seemed like a mixed militia force gathering guns. It seemed like a whole international gathering of various races, political and religious groups in one squad.\n\nAfter he approached the men, one of them spoke to him:\n\n"Don't worry brother, this town is safe now. This town is free of apartheid."\n\nBanele, standing with a confused but somewhat happy look on his face said:"

He himself was an English born socialist who wanted to fight for a right thing in his life and finally fulfil what he taught was his destiny.\n\nAs he sat there thinking of everything that that happened to him for the past few days, his squad member Ndlovu, an African corporal broke the silence:\n\n"Jhonas, I want to ask you something."\n\nCut off from his thinking, Jhonas turned to him and said: "Yes Ndlovu? What did you want to ask?"\n\n"What are you going to do after all this is over? You know, after we win." - Ndlovu asked.\n\n"What I would-" - Jhonas stopped for a second to think before finally answering: "To be honest, I don't really know. Probably go back to my studies and finally get that diploma for political sciences. What about you?"\n\n"Me? I would like to perhaps become a baker in the Cape. Even Lesedi said that she would like to help me with it." - Ndlovu answered him.\n\nAll of the sudden an explosion rang out across the base and almost all hell broke loose. In that moment Jhonas gave and order to the squad to move into the combat but for a second he turned to Ndlovu and told him:"
