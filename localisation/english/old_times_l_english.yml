 old_times_news.1.d:0 "Latest news coming out of the Soviet Union has shocked the world as Gennady Yanayev, a man who was the main instigator of the August Coup that "saved" the Soviet Union has resigned today from the position as General Secretary.\n\nWith the amount of speculations, rumors and theories and with the Kremlin releasing very little information about the resignation of Yanayev, not much is known about the reasons for this sudden move. Many political experts have made conclusions that this was either due to Yanayev’s  inability to fix Union's economic issue or pressure from within the party itself.\n\nHowever, with upcoming congress of the CPSU, this is truly unexpected event that may just change the course of the Soviet Union's global future."

 old_times_news.3.d:0 "Today the government of the Soviet Union has announced that the 10th leader of the USSR and the new General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is Marshal Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov.\n\nBeing a very capable officer and one of the main instigators of the August Coup, Yazov was the most favoured to become the next leader. With all the greetings and celebrations being done, it is believed that Yazov has already begun securing his power with the help of the Soviet military.\n\nMany observers believe that with Yazov's military career and expansionist politics, it is very likely that we would see wars and Soviet military expansion in the following decade."

 old_times_news.4.d:0 "Today the government of the Soviet Union has announced that the 10th leader of the USSR and the new General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the former Minister of the Interior, Boris Pugo.\n\nHolding a lot of respect, both from the CPSU, the public and the KGB, Pugo was one of the more favoured to win the party's vote. It is believed that he has already begun consolidating his position and with KGB support will bring a the USSR to a new age.\n\nMany observers believe that Pugo, being the most hardline person in the party, will bring the Soviet Union back to the days of Yuri Andropov or even Joseph Stalin. What is to come will surely affect the internal situation in the USSR."

 old_times_news.5.t:0 "Gorbachev elected as the General Secretary"
 old_times_news.5.d:0 "Today, in the shocking and almost ironic turn of events, the government of the Soviet Union has announced that the 10th leader of the USSR and the new General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is it's the former and ousted leader, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.\n\nMany outside observers are shocked at this development, however the Kremlin reports state that the almost 10 year house imprisonment and government pressure has lead Gorbachev to change his views.\n\nIs this Mikhail Gorbachev the same one that almost ruined the USSR and got coup'd, or is he a changed new man? For now all that remains is speculations and wild guesses at best. What will become of this new Soviet Union, will it's new leader finish what he started or will it take the same hardline course? Only the time will tell."

 old_times_news.6.d:0 "Today, in a shocking turn of events, the government of the Soviet Union has announced that the 10th leader of the USSR and the new General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the KGB director Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.\n\nMany outside observers note that this development in the USSR was unexpected but not impossible. Putin is a well respected right arm of the party, with KGB being his sword and his party connections being his shield. He is a mysterious and very possibly a powerful man of whom no one, outside of the USSR has any information.\n\nWill he bring in a new course in the USSR or will he continue Yannayev's legacy? It is quite uncertain but one thing is known for sure. This new player in world politics will change the course of possibly not only USSR but the whole world."
