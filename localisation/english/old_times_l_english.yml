 old_times_news.1.d:0 "Latest news coming out of the Soviet Union has shocked the world as Gennady Yanayev, a man who was the main instigator of the August Coup that "saved" the Soviet Union has resigned today from the position as General Secretary.\n\nWith the amount of speculations, rumors and theories and with the Kremlin releasing very little information about the resignation of Yanayev, not much is known about the reasons for this sudden move. Many political experts have made conclusions that this was either due to Yanayev’s  inability to fix Union's economic issue or pressure from within the party itself.\n\nHowever, with upcoming congress of the CPSU, this is truly unexpected event that may just change the course of the Soviet Union's global future."

 old_times_news.57.d:0 "After almost 20 years of constant tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, it would seem that the leadership of two nations has finally chosen peace.\n\nWhile there were attempts of detnate between two nations during the 1970s and late 80s, this will probably be the most stable treaty of mutual understanding and coexistence so far. With both delegations agreeing on the Soviet proposal that would limit the use and manufacturing of ballistic and nuclear missiles, confirm and reinforce the neutral status of Sweden, Austria and Finland as well as establishing trade relations between two blocs, the treaty was signed thus marking what many believe to be the real end of the Cold War.\nMany nations have welcomed this new development as it also marks a new beginning in economies of many other countries."

 old_times_news.58.d:0 "The Vienna Conference that was supposed to ease the tensions between the Soviet Union and United States has taken an unexpected turn yesterday. The United States have rejected the Soviet proposition of "Mutual Trust Treaty" that would see the end of geopolitical tensions between two nations.\n\nAmerican delegation has stated that while the most of the treaty was agreed upon, the recognition of communist governments in Eastern Europe would essentially give Soviet Union a right to limit the political freedoms of people in Eastern Europe.\n\nAfter an almost 4 hour negotiations of back and forth, United States has confirmed its rejection of the Soviet proposal. After this, Soviet delegation has stated that it condemns American decision and rejection of peace and mutual existence.\n\nIt is unknown what the true Soviet intentions were, however this outcome has hurt American international appearance."

 old_times_news.59.d:0 "With the uneasiness still present due to the failure of US-Soviet negotiations, the Warsaw Pact has taken steps in what many see as nothing more than adding fuel to the fire.\n\nThe Soviet and other Warsaw Pact delegations arrived in Budapest two days ago to reaffirm the alliance's position. This has resulted in what is known as "Treaty of Mutual Economic and Military Development" or "The Budapest Treaty". The treaty has reinforcing the internal economic and military relations between the countries of the pact as well as providing more military cooperation between them.\n\nMany view this to be nothing more than just a sham treaty designed to reinforce Moscow's grip over the countries of the bloc. Nevertheless, as there are no countries to oppose the Soviet influence it seems that the Union itself is not willing to let the pact slip out of its grip again."

 flavour_news.2.d:0 "This afternoon, Air France Flight 4590 took off in a fiery blaze from Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, before diving into a nearby hotel and disintegrating. This deadly crash has shaken the French nation, especially since the aircraft - the supersonic Concorde - represented the pride of the French commerical aviation industry.\n\nPresident [FRA.GetLeader] has already publicly expressed his condolences, and French authorities, with assistance from American and British investigators, are already beginning an extensive analysis of the incident. While the cause of the crash has yet to be determined, questions are already being asked about the future of Concorde, and supersonic travel as a whole."

 flavour_news.3.d:0 "This morning, Air France has announced the scaling back of their supersonic Concorde services, reducing the number of active aircraft to just two. Citing rising maintenence costs and an overall unprofitable mode of transport, the company plans to sell the aircrafts to various museums across Europe, in a bid to preserve the 30 year old technological marvels.\n\nWhile French patriots have understandably baulked at the idea, this announcement has not been unsurprising for most, with figures on the programme's costly expenses having been publicly known for years. British Airways have made no announcements yet, however it is expected that they too will reduce their Concorde fleet in the coming months."

The United States saw the most success with 37 gold medals, closely followed by the Soviet Union and China.\n\nMarking the start of the new millenium, these games are already being praised for their quality and entertainment, with some journalists even jokingly remarking that we should 'admit there can never be a better Olympic Games'.\n\nOnce again they prove to be a testament to the international cooperation and sportsmanship that is possible, with athletes being cheered on regardless of nationality. Australia has set a new gold standard, and the next host nation has the difficult task of attempting to reach it."

The Soviet Union saw the most success with 39 gold medals, closely followed by the United States and China.\n\nThis victory is a much-needed boost for [SOV.GetLeader.GetSurname], with the Soviets seemingly reasserting themselves on the world stage after a troublesome decade. Undoubtedly, there will be many happy celebrations in the houses of the Soviet elite tonight.\n\nDespite the political showboating, athletes from all participating nations have been friendly and cooperative, a sign that sportsmanship is universal and without borders. The departing Soviet team were seen off by a crowd of cheerful Australians, taking with them personal souvenirs and good memories."

It seems that Australia has made the most out of their home advantage, narrowly beating the United States to first place by a single gold medal.\n\nAs each visiting nation's team leaves the red continent, celebrations continue in Sydney's streets, with Prime Minister [AUS.GetLeader] making a jovial congratulatory announcement on the evening television news. Several other Pacific nations were quick to join in, with the New Zealand Prime Minister sending Māori souvenirs to each Australian athlete.\n\nBeing the first new top nation since World War 2, many wonder if Australia's success is just a fluke, or whether the American-Soviet olympic hegemony has finally been broken."

Although hopes were high for the first games of the new millenium, the international event has been beset by trouble.\n\nWater issues in the Olympic Village left athletes dehydrated for days, an unlucky case of severe food poisoning has forced the Japanese team to withdraw, and multiple guests and staff members have been treated in hospital for mosquito-borne diseases.\n\nThe United States earned the most gold medals, but the team quickly rushed off home, clearly not keen to spend any more time in the host country. With their reputation wounded, Australia is unlikely to host another Olympic Games anytime soon."

 flavour_news.10.d:0 "Introduced in the 16th century, the Gregorian calendar has become the most ubiquitous calendar in the modern world. Like most calendars of the past millennia, it attempts to rectify its long-term imprecision by adding leap days and years with mathmetical calculation.\n\nEvery year divisible by four is a leap year, and therefore receives an extra day, the 29th February. However, this simple system results in three extra leap days every 400 years, so in the Gregorian calendar, century years are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. This results in century leap years every 400 years, and this year is one of those rare years, being only the second one to occur since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar itself."

While initial reports are chaotic and in some cases contradictory, death toll estimates are already climbing into the hundred thousands, and there are reports of areas as far west as East Africa being affected.\n\nLikely one of the worst earthquakes recorded in over a century, the affected countries will need years of foreign aid and reconstruction to recover. Beyond the initial impact, there is likely huge amounts of economic and environmental devastation, the solving of which will strain the politics of many nations.\n\nThere is also no doubt that great powers will use this opportunity to expand their influence in the region, for a price of course..."
