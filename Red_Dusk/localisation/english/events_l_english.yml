 ussr.1.t:0 "Union in Hibernation"
 ussr.1.d:0 "It has been less then 10 years from that fateful day, August 19th, 1991. The moment those tanks rolled into Moscow, nobody knew that we would be changing history; nobody understood the gravity of the situation at hand, of the unfolding events that would change the very course of Russia's path. In only about a week, our troops had secured Moscow and Leningrad, and with them, our greatest political opponents, traitors to the Soviet Union--men like Boris Yeltsin, who for his High Crimes against the party and Presidium were silently and swiftly "removed" from Politics. Some like Gorbachev were put under house arrest or simply moved away from government; others simply disappeared from the face of the Earth without a trace, so said the newspapers, now firmly back under the control of the General Secretary. It took a while, but soon enough, the nation had come to be stabilized enough for business to resume as usual; we had felt the sting of a sudden shift in power, seen the damage of a rapid passing off of such great authority, and yet we had weathered the storm. The Union would live on, and the "Great Reformer" would be put back on the shelf while Yanayev did what had to be done in order to save our most glorious motherland from demise. The Union would prevail; the Communist Dream, Lenin's great project, would continue onwards without falter, and we would no longer be so easily corrupted by the insidious influences of the Imperialist West! At least we hoped...  When we had committed to the movement, when we had put our support behind the Coup, we knew there would be consequences, some as dire as member states leaving, an economic shock, a political upheaval--and we knew we could deal with it all, one by one, step by step if need be. And yet here we stood, a nation hobbling its way along with one foot in an open grave, a red not so vibrant as the triumphant revolutionary it had once been. Where was Marx's sunrise? Our Glorious Red Star?"
 ussr.1.a:0 "Replaced by a Red Dusk."
 ussr.2.t:0 "The Feared Report"
 ussr.2.d:0 "The Union has undergone many reforms and changes in both positive and negative forms. It was a tough time but we marched on. After extensive investigations in the 1990s, the enemies of the state have been found and removed, except Mikhail Gorbachev, as he is considered to no longer be a threat to the stability of the Union. Further, the new head of the army is Dimitry Yazov, a feared and capable man that will lead the reformed Soviet Army. The new head of the KGB is a promising young man named Vladimir Putin, and he will be instrumental to the Soviet Union. Boris Pugo will be the permanent minister of Internal Affairs, as he played a big part in the August Coup so he will remain at his position."
 ussr.2.a:0 "Interesting"
 ussr.3.t:0 "The Economy Report"
 ussr.3.d:0 "The economy has never been as it is now. Even during the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, it was not as bad. Blockades, sanctions, and economic wars have been imposed on us by the West for over 50 years now. All of them with one goal: to cripple us. Sad to say that it appears that they are working. The Union's only future is to either reform or vanish. Our over-militarized economy is of no help either. As much as we can show our teeth to the West, if we cannot take care of our people first, it will lead to a disaster. We will have to do some reforming or the Union of the People will not last."
 ussr.3.a:0 "The Capitalists will pay!"
 ussr.4.t:0 "Yazov Protests"
 ussr.4.d:0 "Marshal Yazov issued a protest against Yanayev's decision of defunding the army. In his letter he stated that: “A country without a strong military cannot defend the workers’ revolution!”. As much as he is right, we cannot focus on only the military while our people worry about their future. This has triggered a party meeting about all the recent actions and the current state of the Soviet Union."
 ussr.4.a:0 "He should know his place"
 ussr.5.t:0 "The Resignation of Yanayev"
 ussr.5.d:0 "It was a quiet, normal morning in the office of the Politburo. Meeting announced by General Secretary Yanayev was unexpected to say the least, but none of the members of the highest governing body of the Soviet Union were ready for what was to come. Yanayev, General Secretary of the Soviet Union for the past decade and one of the instigators of the coup that saved the USSR, has resigned. Members of the Politburo were in shock but also very nervous. The moment they were waiting for came, as with Yanayev gone, it is finally their chance to become leaders of the Soviet Union. And it came just at the right time before the Party meeting."
 ussr.5.a:0 "Unexpected"
