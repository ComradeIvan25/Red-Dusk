 SOV_memories_of_perestroika_name_desc:0 "Memories and the consequences of Gorbachev's failed economic reforms, so called "Perestroika”, are still strong.

 SOV_memories_of_august_coup_name_desc:0 "The August Coup, our last ditch effort to save our beloved Union, was a success. But at what cost?

 SOV_stagnating_economy_name:0 "Stagnating economy"
 SOV_stagnating_economy_name_desc:0 "Ever since the Great Patriotic War, our nation's greatest problem is its own economy. 50 years of economic wars, blockades, failed reforms, and corruption, have crippled our economy.

 SOV_militarised_industry_name:0 "Militarised industry"
 SOV_militarised_industry_name_desc:0 "The Soviet Army, the sword and the shield of Socialism, is a huge and strong force. This is both a blessing and a curse for our nation. Nobody would even think of invading us, but the constant arms race with the West has done nothing but make our industry heavily focused on the military. Reforms were made, but we do not think they can do much. And with Yazov pressing to militaries it even more, we are at a breaking point."
 SOV_party_infighting_name:0 "Party infighting"
 SOV_party_infighting_name_desc:0 "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the first successful workers party, had many ups and downs since it was founded.

 SOV_rising_separatism_name_desc:0 "With the end of the Warsaw Pact and the August Coup, many nationalities in our SSRs have begun to corrupt themselves with separatism, mainly in Ukraine, Lithuania, and Chechnya.

 USA_three_party_primacy_name:0 "The Three Party Primacy"
 USA_three_party_primacy_name_desc:0 "In Contrast to prior years, the American nation has seemingly become a Three-party Nation rather than the usual two-party. While this does help to allow political divide to stay away from the usual us-vs.-them mentality, it also makes getting legislation through much harder..."
 USA_second_amendment_name:0 "The Second Amendment"
 USA_second_amendment_name_desc:0 "Part of the Bill of Rights, and arguably the most vital to American liberty, the Right to Bear Arms is one of the oldest standing gun-rights legislations in the world, allowing all American citizens to privately arm themselves–with caveats of course. With this, behind every blade of grass stands an American with a rifle..."

 USA_misdirected_foreign_policy_name:0 "Misdirected Foreign Policy"
 USA_misdirected_foreign_policy_name_desc:0 "With the House and Senate so divided, getting anything done is difficult, let alone choosing our direction in foreign affairs, especially on matters of our international policy with the Soviets–to continue the war or let it die, to fight on or take the victory lap. And because of that, our relations are taking a toll as our Representatives bicker and complain over what’s what and who’s who."
 USA_military_spending_name:0 "Over-Bloated Military Spending"
 USA_military_spending_name_desc:0 "The Cold War wasn’t just a political and social upheaval, but the threat of Communism in the states also led to a massive, several-decade long fight to overpower the Soviets and the Chinese every step of the way. Well, this costs a lot of money, resources, and soldiers, and as it stands, we’re starting to see the negative outcomes of a 50-year-long pissing contest with the Russians."
 USA_last_bastion_name:0 "The “Last Bastion”"
 USA_last_bastion_name_desc:0 "What makes America the Last Bastion on Earth? It’s the shining beacon of Democracy and Capitalism in the world; the city on the hill so to speak.
