 ussr.1.t:0 "A successful coup"
 ussr.1.d:0 "After a successful coup in the august 1991 the soviet union focused on stability and reclaiming its lost power. During the coup the Warsaw pact had been dissolved and all countries in it formed new governments following western ideals. The Soviet Union lost many territories including: Estonia, Latvia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The current state of the Soviet Union is yet to be known."
 ussr.1.a:0 "we saved the union but at what cost ?"
 ussr.2.t:0 "The feared report"
 ussr.2.d:0 "The Union has undergone many reforms and changes in both positive and negative forms. It was a tough time but we marched on. After extensive investigations the enemies of the state have been found and removed back in the 1990s, all except Michael Gorbachov, Gorbachov is still too popular to be killed. Further the new head of the army is Dimitry Yazov, a feared and capable man to lead the reformed Soviet army. The new head of the KGB is a promising young man named Vladimir Putin, he will be instrumental to the Soviet Union. Boris Pugo will be the permanent minister of Internal affairs, he played a big part in the August coup thus he will remain at his position."

 ussr.3.t:0 "The Economy Report"
 ussr.3.d:0 "The economy has never been as it is now even during the beginnings of the great patriotic war it wasn’t as bad as it is now. Blocades, sanctions, and economic wars have been imposed on us by the west for over 50 years now. All of them with one goal, to cripple us. Sad to say that it appears they are working. The Union's only future is to either reform or wanish. Our over militarized economy is of no help either. As much as we can show our teeth to the west, if we cannot take care of our people first, it will lead to a disaster. We will have to do some reforming or this Union of the People won’t last."
 ussr.3.a:0 "the capitalists will pay!"
 ussr.4.t:0 "Yazov protests"
 ussr.4.d:0 "Marshal Yazov issued a protest against the defunding of the army. In his letter he stated that “A country without a strong military cannot defend the workers revolution!”. As much as he is right, we cannot focus only on the military while our people worry about their future. This has triggered a party meeting about all the recent actions and the current state of the Soviet Union."
 ussr.4.a:0 "he should know his place"
 ussr.5.t:0 "The resignation of Yanayev"
 ussr.5.d:0 "It was a quite normal morning in the office of the Politburo. Meeting announced by the General Secretary Yanayev was unexpected to say the least but none of the members of the highest governing body of the Soviet Union were ready for what was to come. Yanayev, General Secretary of the Soviet Union for the past decade and one instigators of the coup that saved the USSR has resigned. Members of the Politburo were in shock but also very nervous. The moment they were waiting for finally came, with Yanayev gone it was finally their chance to become leaders of the Soviet Union. And it came just at the right time before the party meeting."
